## 1. Introduction
Blockchain is a world-changing technology, but it suffers from some pain points:
1.	Installing, configuring, securing, troubleshooting, updating, and maintaining a blockchain ecosystem is a complex and time consuming task.
2.	There are 100+ blockchains and distributed ledger systems to choose from
3.	Building blockchain solutions from the ground up is very expensive and time consuming.
4. There is a severe shortage of skilled blockchain developers.
 
Primechain APIs make it very simple for developers to add blockchain power to their code - smart asset lifecycle management, electronic signatures, encrypted data storage & more.

## 4. Availability
Primechain-API is available in 2 modes:
* remote service - this is where the API service runs on the Primechain Cloud and the data is stored on your servers.
* local service - this is where the API service runs on your servers and the data is stored on your servers.

In both options, the data is stored 100% on your servers (on-cloud / on-premise).
