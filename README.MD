## 1. Introduction
Blockchain is a world-changing technology, but it suffers from some pain points:
1.	Installing, configuring, securing, troubleshooting, updating, and maintaining a blockchain ecosystem is a complex and time consuming task.
2.	There are 100+ blockchains and distributed ledger systems to choose from
3.	Building blockchain solutions from the ground up is very expensive and time consuming.
4. There is a severe shortage of skilled blockchain developers.
 
Primechain APIs make it very simple for developers to add blockchain power to their code - smart asset lifecycle management, electronic signatures, encrypted data storage & more.

## 4. Availability
Primechain-API is available in 2 modes:
* a node on Primechain-MONEY, a multi-framework permissioned blockchain available only to BankChain members. The API runs on your infrastructure (on-cloud / on-premise).
* dedicated service - this is where the API runs on your infrastructure (on-cloud / on-premise) and all the data is stored on your infrastructure (on-cloud / on-premise).

## 5. About Primechain Technologies
Primechain API are developed and maintained by [Primechainâ„¢ Technologies Pvt. Ltd.](http://www.primechaintech.com), a blockchain startup with the mission of building blockchains for a better world. We operate the Bankchain community of banks and maintain the Blockchain Security Controls.

## 7. Standards and algorithms

[Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/4/final), specifies three NIST-approved digital signature algorithms: DSA, RSA, and ECDSA. All three are used to generate and verify digital signatures, in conjunction with an approved hash function specified in [FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/180/4/final) or [FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/202/final).

## 8. Glossary of terms
* AAD: Additional Authenticated Data 
* AES: Advanced Encryption Standard.
* Authentication Tag (Tag): A cryptographic checksum on data that is designed to reveal both accidental errors and the intentional modification of the data. 
* GCM: Galois/Counter Mode
* Initialization Vector: A nonce that is associated with an invocation of authenticated encryption on a particular plaintext and AAD.
