## 1. Introduction
Blockchain is a world-changing technology, but it suffers from some pain points:
1.	Installing, configuring, securing, troubleshooting, updating, and maintaining a blockchain ecosystem is a complex and time consuming task.
2.	There are 100+ blockchains and distributed ledger systems to choose from
3.	Building blockchain solutions from the ground up is very expensive and time consuming.
4. There is a severe shortage of skilled blockchain developers.
 
Primechain APIs make it very simple for developers to add blockchain power to their code - smart asset lifecycle management, electronic signatures, encrypted data storage & more.
