# Data storage

MultiChain streams enable a blockchain to be used as a general purpose append-only database, with the blockchain providing timestamping, notarization and immutability. A MultiChain blockchain can contain any number of streams, where the data published in every stream is stored by every node. If a node chooses to subscribe to a stream, it will index that streamâ€™s contents to enable efficient retrieval in various ways.
